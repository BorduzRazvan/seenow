Social-evaluative anxiety was initially defined as the experience of distress, discomfort,fear, anxiety, etc., in social situations; as the deliberate avoidance of social situations; and finally as a fear of receiving negative evaluations from others. The first two aspects were combined to compose a Social Avoidance and Distress (SAD) scale, and the last factor was employed to compose a Fear of Negative Evaluation (FNE) scale.

The SAD scale was divided into two subscales, social avoidance and social distress
Social avoidance was defined as avoiding being with, talking to, or escaping from others for any reason. 

Social distress was defined as the reported experience of a negative emotion, such as being upset, distressed, tense, or anxious, in social interactions, or the reported lack of negative emotion, such as being relaxed, calm, at ease, or comfortable. 

Fear of negative evaluation was defined as apprehension about others' evaluations, distress over their negative evaluations, avoidance of evaluative situations, and the expectation that others would evaluate oneself negatively.
